# Changelog

All notable changes to lamco-rdp-server will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.4-hyperv.1] - 2026-09-04

Hyper-V Enhanced Session, KWin virtual outputs, and packaging for this fork.
All changes are relative to upstream 1.4.4; the Cargo.toml version stays 1.4.4
and the `-hyperv.N` suffix identifies this fork's release lineage.

### Added

**Hyper-V Enhanced Session transport** (opt-in)
- AF_VSOCK listener under `[server.transports.vsock]` (`enabled = true`),
  with a connection-ID allowlist for Hyper-V guests
- Hyper-V auto-detection logs a hint when the transport is disabled
- Pre-auth handshake deadline (X.224 / TLS / CredSSP) so a silent peer can
  no longer park the single-connection accept loop

**KWin virtual output sessions (`kwin-virtual`)**
- Native per-connection virtual display at the client's requested resolution
  on KDE Plasma 6+ via `zkde-screencast`; dialog-free, elastic resize
- Wire input via the libei/EIS machinery with persistent event consumption

**Client-visible cursor & shutdown improvements**
- Guest cursor shape sent to the client (xrdp parity), session-scoped
  transparent console cursor theme
- Graceful disconnect via client-visible ErrorInfo instead of a bare quit

**Encoders**
- x264 AVC420 software encoder (2-3x faster than OpenH264) loaded at
  runtime via dlopen — ships in this build; needs `libx264` on the target,
  otherwise falls back to OpenH264 automatically. AVC444 always uses
  OpenH264. x264 carries no patent grant; the exposure sits with whoever
  installs libx264.

**Packaging**
- New `scripts/build-release-artifacts.sh` builds a prebuilt `.deb` and a
  portable `tar.gz` with `install.sh` (single source of truth for local
  and CI builds; GitHub Releases are published from tags `v1.4.4-hyperv.N`)

### Fixed

- 1366x768-class freezes caused by un-normalized padded capture strides
- Damage regions consumed but never sent after an encoding-path stall
- libei dead device handle after a resolution switch; region-offset
  double-offset in multi-output sessions

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added

**Full-Featured Configuration GUI**
- Professional dark theme with Lamco branding
- 10-tab interface covering all 85+ configuration parameters:
  - Server: Listen address, connections, timeouts, XDG portals
  - Security: TLS certificates, authentication, NLA
  - Video: Codec selection, FPS, quality, latency modes
  - Input: Keyboard layout, mouse behavior, touch support
  - Clipboard: Synchronization, rate limiting, MIME filtering
  - Logging: Log levels, output destinations, rotation
  - Performance: Buffer sizes, threading, damage detection
  - EGFX: H.264 encoding, IDR keyframes, chroma subsampling
  - Advanced: Service registry, experimental features
  - Status: Server control, live logs, system info
- TLS certificate generation wizard
- Server process management (start/stop/restart from GUI)
- Live log viewer with filtering
- Real-time configuration validation
- Import/Export configuration files
- Hardware detection and capability display

**GUI Framework**
- Built with iced 0.14 (pure Rust, cross-platform)
- Optional feature (`--features gui`) - server works without GUI
- Separate binary: `lamco-rdp-server-gui`
- Professional enterprise aesthetic (dark theme like Grafana/DataDog)

### Changed

- Version bump to 1.0.0 (stable release)

### Upgrade Notes

To run the GUI:
```bash
# Build with GUI feature
cargo build --release --features gui

# Run GUI
./target/release/lamco-rdp-server-gui
```

Or via Flatpak (when available):
```bash
flatpak run io.lamco.rdp-server-gui
```

## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added

**Multi-Strategy Session Persistence**
- Mutter Direct API strategy (GNOME, zero dialogs)
- wlr-direct strategy (wlroots native protocols, zero dialogs)
- Portal + libei/EIS strategy (Flatpak-compatible wlroots)
- Portal + Restore Tokens strategy (universal, Portal v4+)
- Basic Portal fallback strategy
- Automatic strategy selection based on compositor detection
- Encrypted credential storage (Secret Service, TPM 2.0, encrypted file)

**Service Advertisement Registry**
- 18 advertised services with 4-level guarantees (Guaranteed, BestEffort, Degraded, Unavailable)
- Runtime feature detection and translation (Wayland capabilities → RDP features)
- Compositor-specific profiles (GNOME, KDE, wlroots, COSMIC)
- Service-based decision making for codec selection, FPS tuning, cursor mode

**Video & Graphics**
- H.264 video encoding via EGFX graphics pipeline
- AVC420 (4:2:0 chroma) and AVC444 (4:4:4 chroma) codec support
- Hardware-accelerated encoding (VA-API for Intel/AMD, NVENC for NVIDIA)
- Damage region detection with SIMD optimization (90%+ bandwidth savings)
- Adaptive FPS (5-60 FPS based on screen activity)
- Latency governor (interactive/balanced/quality modes)
- Periodic IDR keyframe generation for artifact clearing

**Input & Interaction**
- Complete keyboard and mouse support (200+ key mappings)
- Multi-monitor coordinate transformation
- Predictive cursor with physics-based latency compensation
- Touch input support (experimental)

**Clipboard**
- Bidirectional clipboard synchronization
- Text, image, and file transfer support
- Loop detection and prevention
- FUSE-based on-demand file transfer
- Format conversion (15+ clipboard formats)
- Rate limiting for Portal compatibility

**Deployment & Compatibility**
- Flatpak packaging with sandbox permissions
- systemd user and system service files
- RPM and DEB package specifications
- Automatic compositor detection (GNOME, KDE, wlroots, COSMIC)
- Portal capability probing
- Deployment context detection (Flatpak, systemd, native)

**Configuration & Management**
- Comprehensive TOML configuration with all options
- Environment variable support
- CLI diagnostic commands (--show-capabilities, --persistence-status, --diagnose)
- User-friendly error messages with troubleshooting hints

### Tested Platforms

- ✅ Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (GNOME 46, Portal v5) - Full RDP functionality
- ✅ RHEL 9.7 (GNOME 40, Portal v4) - Video and input working (no clipboard)
- ⚠️ Pop!_OS 24.04 COSMIC - Limited support (Portal RemoteDesktop not implemented)

See `docs/DISTRO-TESTING-MATRIX.md` for complete compatibility matrix.

### Known Issues

**GNOME Session Persistence**
- GNOME portal backend rejects persistence for RemoteDesktop sessions (policy decision)
- Mutter Direct API strategy bypasses this limitation on GNOME 42+
- Impact: Permission dialog required on each server restart with Portal strategy

**COSMIC Desktop**
- Portal RemoteDesktop interface not implemented in COSMIC
- Waiting on Smithay PR #1388 (Ei protocol support)
- Impact: No input injection available on COSMIC in Flatpak

**Portal Clipboard (Ubuntu 24.04)**
- xdg-desktop-portal-gnome may crash on complex Excel paste operations
- Impact: Session becomes unusable after crash
- Workaround: Avoid pasting Excel with 15+ formats
